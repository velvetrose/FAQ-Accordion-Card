## Overview
I have designed this page using HTML, CSS and vanilla javascript with a small animation for the Desktop version.
You can hover over the animation element to watch some colours change.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked

## My process

I started with the According Menu Design. Once i finished working on it's CSS style, I worked on it's functionality. Then I proceeded to attach the illustrations that were provided and styled it responsively for Desktop and Mobile view. Finally i spent some time animating the moving Box illustration.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

I learnt a lot about how to use pseudo-elements like ::before and ::after along with animation these elements. Additionally, it was a good experience to practice working on Accordion Menus although these can be done via frameworks like Bootstrap for example.


### Useful resources

- [Accordion Menus using Vanilla Javascript](https://softauthor.com/accordion-menu-in-vanilla-javascript/) - I referred this to create the accordion menus that only open one at a time. I am very grateful for this resource.
